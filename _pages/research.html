  <p><strong>Intergenerational Income Mobility: A multivariate distribution regression approach</strong><br>
  with <em>J.Meier, B.Melly & C.Naguib</em><br>
  Abstract: We study intergenerational income mobility in Switzerland using multivariate distribution regression. We estimate the joint cumulative distribution of children's and parents' income controlling for different explanatory variables. Derivation of specific mobility measures from the joint cumulative distribution is straightforward, and taking covariates into account during the estimation of the joint distribution enables us to gain deeper insights into drivers of intergenerational income mobility. Further, this innovative approach allows us to decompose structural from compositional differences. Results focus on mobility differences between sons and daughters. Specifically, we find that a higher father's income share for sons is related to higher upward mobility. However, this relationship does not hold for daughters. We further analyze differences in mobility outcomes between sons and daughters and conduct a decomposition analysis. The decomposition shows that average hours worked are crucial in explaining the differences between sons and daughters. Nevertheless, a large part of these observed differences remains unexplained.</p>
