Thanks for dropping by! I am a PhD candidate in Econometrics at the [Departement of Economics](https://www.vwi.unibe.ch/index_eng.html) at the Universtiy of Bern. 

My research centers on Econometrics and Empirical Microeconometrics, with a focus on distribution-related questions. Moreover, I am interested in natural language processing methods to access and analyze new text data. 

Below you find some insights of my current research:
